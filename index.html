        Polina Korobkova is a composer and text manufacturer, 
        blending discursive reflection with practical experiments 
        in written scores, live performances, and recorded tracks. 
        Emphasizing art as analysis, our work explores theoretical 
        abstractions and significant topics such as memory, performativity,
        power structures, and identity. We use various mediums and instruments,
        and since 2023, we've been teaching at Stuttgart University of Music and Arts.
        We reject social or national categorization."
