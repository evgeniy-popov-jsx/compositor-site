    description: `
    contemporary world is often presented to us as a place where all frontiers have been erased. usually this signifies a rather naïve conception of a globalised society, where cultural differences and class barriers are no longer present. yet, a vision of a borderless world is a common trope in many classics of horror genre. for instance, in junji ito’s »town without streets«, the disappearance of walls becomes a trigger for catastrophic social tremors. when boundaries between private and public blur, uncanniness (das unheimliche) fills the transformed space.
    exhibited in the form of catalogue, eight private apartments are being governed by bio-political strategies of background music, borrowed from public spaces and applied to every-day existence. confusion and doubt pervade all layers of the work, as if relentlessly attempting to draw the inexistent line between the real and the artificial.

    how can i trust that my concealed, intimate memories are real if i don’t have an ability to catch them? each time i try to depict their virtuality in sung gestures and grasp their presence, i lose those materialised phenomena once again, as they slip away in the irreversibility of time.
    yet, what happens if there is a mechanical machine juxtaposed to me, which can separate my gestures from my body and reproduce them precisely the same way over and over back at me? what impact does this encounter have on me and my act of recalling? what reaction does it trigger? does it make my existence more reliable or does it only sow more uncertainty and fears?
    our composed ritual is an attempt not only to deal with, but also to live through all these questions.
    the trial version was performed at kunstraum walcheturm, zurich and gare du nord, basel. however, it’s still a work-in-progress, seeking it’s ultimate realisation.

    all spaces are haunted with ghosts, some are more exposed to their influence than others. virtuality is not exclusively what once was, but also what could be and what is. it is an illusion, but an efficient one.
    a place can be a catalyst of past breaking through. under certain circumstances, there is no escape from obeying to it. then one is left with nothing, but out-of-joint time and bitter beauty of its decay.
    our piece explores juxtaposition of two memory zones - personal and collective, encountered on a viennese train station. field recordings are emitted from the vibration of instruments’ bodies by means of transducers. our intimate, reverent recollections are played over them — while disturbing, shifting and altering the ‘objective’ documentation. random mix of ‘romantic’ pieces from the loudspeakers on the station melts with live performance.

    can one transmit memories of sensibility to another being? is it possible to share the intimacy of connection with a musical instrument? this project is making an attempt to grasp, to notate and to recompose relation to playing and to ritualise it in shifting repetitions.
    based on analyses of corporal recollections from our pianist childhood, mental archeology takes place in the realm of famous piano repertoire we performed or wished to perform. whether or not flashbacks of physical touch, combined with phantom pain, are transferable, the outcome of this implantation surgery is to be witnessed.
    written for and performed by dmitry batalov in the context of the international piano compétition of orléans, france, as well as by alexandra sikorskaya and the author in zurich university of arts, and jean-pierre collot as part of ukrainian evenings in bayerische akademie der schönen künste, munich.

    what if one tabooed all personalised artistic choices and undertook a procedure of self-negation. striving to deny one’s authorship means exposing oneself to something else, becoming an incubator for the else. 
    but where does one end and the outside begin? an experiment, doomed from the start, endeavours to capture the clashes and the cracks in interaction of the self with the alien. 
    each cut is a transcription of some found material by structured re-listening. the temporal frame and the rules of the transcribing process are prescribed, whereas the written out remains unregulated.
