  on collaborating with us
  we treasure composing as a way of thinking and structuring. it is therefore not necessarily linked to sounds. we aim for unidentifiable occurrences which are in-between various mediums, genres and forms.    
  we are not efficient, not formatted and not functional. we have zero interest in contemporary music as genre.
  each of our projects brings us to an unknown territory and we can never be sure what the final result will be. please don’t expect from us to reproduce what we have already done - it won’t be possible. we understand experimental art as a risky activity, which contains a possibility of failure. we consider it of value  — not of disadvantage. 
  it’s important for us to work with people in all their complexity and inconsistency. we see performers as co-collaborators and consider not merely musical qualities, but also personalities, physical representations and intimate experiences.
  a lot of our pieces can be tricky to realise as we ask for special skills, performative actions and unusual equipment. we are sceptical of the concert hall format and want to bring our performances to the streets, to different places, to different beings. 
  if you are interested in challenges and fascinated by the glow of the unknown as we are — please, reach out to us! we’re always open to new friends, ideas and proposals.
